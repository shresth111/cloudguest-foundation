# file is base64'd into the command payload, so there is nothing to bootstrap
# on the box and the version that runs is always the version in the repo that
# triggered the deploy.

#     api       -> also recreates celery-worker and celery-beat, which run the
#                  SAME image and would otherwise be left on the old code
#                  talking to a migrated database.
#     frontend  -> recreates frontend only.
#
# VERBATIM COPY. The canonical copy is cloud-guest/deploy/remote-deploy.sh; this
# one exists so this repo's workflow is self-contained (same deliberate
# duplication the repos already use for MIN_PAGES). Fix bugs THERE and copy
# here in the same PR.
#
# WHY IMAGE REFS AND NOT `git pull && docker compose build`
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Confirmed on the box 2026-08-27: both checkouts under ~/deploy have
# uncommitted local modifications (foundation: MasterShell.tsx, routeTree.gen.ts,
# two untracked files; cloud-guest: nine modified files under
# backend/app/domains/wireguard plus ops/hub-agents/wg_agent.py). A `git pull`
# deploy would either refuse to merge or quietly ship whatever a human left in
# the working tree. A `git checkout -f`/`git clean` deploy would delete
# ~/deploy/cloud-guest/backend/.env, which is the stack's entire production
# configuration and is not in git. Neither is a thing to automate.
#
# Building here is also a bad trade on its own terms: m6i.large, 2 vCPU,
# ~1 GB free RAM while serving live traffic. A bun/vite build and a pip
# install alongside uvicorn and two celery workers is a latency incident.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT ASSUMES EXISTS (see the enable-list)
#   * ~/deploy/docker-compose.yml with `image: ${API_IMAGE}` /
#     `image: ${FRONTEND_IMAGE}` instead of `build:` stanzas -- the version
#     committed alongside this file at deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml.
#   * The instance role can pull from ECR and (for api) write to
#     s3://wyfy-guest-app-storage-1787805585.
